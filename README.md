# Predicting English Premier League Match Results

This is the libarary for my [application](http://match-prediction.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/) that predicts EPL match results. 


## Motivation

I wanted to create an application that helps answer one of the most fundamental questions for sports fans: who will win? As an avid football fan, I have built an app for fans to interact with and obtain match predictions for the English Premier League. The app allows users to select teams for the home and away sides and produces win probabilities based on the user inputs.
